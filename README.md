# Tool to scrap books from the Gutenberg project site

Anybody can download a book from the internet thanks to the people from https://gutenberg.org/.

"python words_from_gutenberg.py your_link new_file"

For example:

"python words_from_gutenberg.py  https://gutenberg.org/files/2701/2701-h/2701-h.htm new_file.csv"
